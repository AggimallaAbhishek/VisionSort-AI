Runtime and Deployment Events (Exact Where Captured)
-----------------------------------------------------
- [2026-02-19 18:05:49 GMT] Render URL checks returned 404 with x-render-routing=no-server:
  - GET https://visionsort-ai-backend.onrender.com/
  - GET https://visionsort-ai-backend.onrender.com/api

- [2026-02-20 11:00:36.424746 +0000] Async upload job created (job_id=988ba79beb204a9cb686d5abca57b8b5)
- [2026-02-20 11:00:56.712836 +0000] Same async job completed successfully
  Duration: ~20.29 seconds for 1 file in that run

- [time not captured in terminal output] S3 bucket permissions fixed:
  - visionsort-uploads-vin HEAD OK / PUT OK
  - visionsort-processed-vin HEAD OK / PUT OK

- [time not captured in terminal output] Backend health confirmed with AWS and CORS config active

- [time not captured in terminal output] AI label flow validated locally and in Render

- [time not captured in terminal output] Performance probe showed fast root but very slow synchronous upload (~490s), leading to timeout hardening work
